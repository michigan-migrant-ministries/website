    <h3>Our purpose</h3>
    <p>
      From April to October of each year, Berrien County teems with Mexicans who come to work a seasonal agricultural
      job. We focus on teaching the Word of God to these Migrant families so that they might hear the Gospel, believe on
      the Lord Jesus, and be discipled in their new life with Christ.
