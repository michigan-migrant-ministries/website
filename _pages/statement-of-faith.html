<h1>We believe...</h1>
<p>
  <i>That <q>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,</q></i> by which we
  understand that the whole book called The Bible to be inerrant in the original
  writing; that its teaching is absolute and that the Holy Spirit guided the
  chosen holy men of God in all that they wrote. {% include verse.html verse="2
  Peter 1:21; 2 Timothy 3:16" %}
</p>
<p>
  <i>The Godhead eternally exists in three Persons:</i> God the Father, God the
  Son and God the Holy Spirit. These three are One and possess the same
  attributes, perfection and nature. {% include verse.html verse="Matthew 28:19;
  John 17:5; Genesis 1:1, 1:3; I John 5:7" %}
</p>
<p>
  <i>In the Deity of Jesus of the Lord Jesus Christ</i> who was begotten by the
  Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary; that Jesus Christ was fully man yet
  remained and still remains fully God. {% include verse.html verse="Colossians
  1:14-17; John 1:1, 14, 10:30; Matthew 1:20" %}
</p>
<p>
  <i>In the Personality and Deity of the Holy Spirit</i> who indwells every true
  believer; who convicts of sin, comforts and makes intercession for the saints.

<p>
  <i>That man was created in the image of God, after His likeness, but that the
  whole human race fell in the sin of Adam and was brought under eternal
  condemnation and judgment;</i> that man can in no way obtain forgiveness and
  salvation through any work of his own. {% include verse.html verse="Genesis
  1:26-27; Romans 5:12, 3:10, 3:23; Titus 3:5" %}
</p>
<p>
  <i>That Jesus Christ became the sinner’s only substitute before God</i> and
  died as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the whole world; that
  salvation comes through no other than Jesus Christ. {% include verse.html
  verse="I John 2:2; 2 Corinthians 5:21; I Peter 2:24; Acts 5:12" %}
</p>
<p>
  <i>In the resurrection of the crucified body of Jesus Christ, that His body
  was raised from the dead and that He ascended into Heaven and sitteth on the
  right hand of God</i> as the believer’s High Priest and Advocate. {% include
  verse.html verse="Mark 16:19; Luke 24:39; Acts 1:10-11; Hebrews 1:3" %}

  <i>In the personal and bodily return of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</i>
  {% include verse.html verse="Acts 1:11; I Thessalonians 4:16-17" %}
</p>
<p>
  <i>That the souls of the those who have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ for
  salvation do at death immediately pass into God’s presence and there remain in
  conscious bliss until the resurrection of the body at His coming, when soul
  and body reunite shall be with Him forever in glory.</i> {% include verse.html

</p>
<p>
  <i>That the souls of the lost remain after death in misery until the final
  judgment of the great white throne when soul and body reunited at the
  resurrection shall be cast <q>into the lake of fire</q></i> which is <q>the
  second death</q> to <q>be punished with everlasting destruction from the
  presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power</q> {% include

  the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world</q>. {% include
  verse.html verse="Revelation 12:9, 20:10; I Peter 5:8" %}
</p>
<p>
  We belive the Bible’s clear teaching that marriage is only between one man and
  one woman. <q>Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave
  unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh</q> and <q>Thou shalt not lie with
  mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination</q>. {% include verse.html
