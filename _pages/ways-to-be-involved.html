  <p>
    Be willing to abide by our dress code for working with Michigan Migrant

  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      All workers during Day Camp hours will be required to wear the Camp T-shirt
    </li>
    <li>
      Ladies, please wear culottes or loose fitting skirts. (Straight skirts are
      not recommended for working and playing with children!) Skirts must cover
      the knees when sitting. Leggings or a slip may be necessary. However, even
      if you wear leggings, the skirt must come to the bottom of the knee cap when
      sitting. If your skirt has a slit in it, the slit may not show any higher
      than the knee. Culottes are sometimes difficult to find. If you need help
      finding some, visit <a href="https://dressingforhisglory.com/">
      https://dressingforhisglory.com/</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Loose pants or shorts may be worn after Day Camp hours, but the shorts must
      cover the knee cap when sitting
    </li>
    <li>
      Other shirts may be worn after Camp hours but cannot show any cleavage. No
      tank tops, spaghetti strap, sleeveless or tight fitting. If in doubt, leave
      it at home!
    </li>
    <li>
      Men, if you wear shorts they must cover your knees when sitting. No tank
      tops or sleeveless
    </li>
    <li>
      Men and ladies: if you choose to do any visiting in the migrant farms, the
      men must wear pants and the ladies must wear skirts which cover the knees
      when sitting
    </li>
    <li>
      No rock music or Christian Contemporary music may be played while on the
      premises during the weeks of Camp
    </li>

    Thank you for upholding these standards while working with the children and
    families during Camp!
