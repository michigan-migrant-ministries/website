<p>
  <i>That <q>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,</q></i> by which we
  understand that the whole book called The Bible to be inerrant in the original
  writing; that it’s teaching is absolute and that the Holy Spirit guided the
  chosen holy men of God in all that they wrote. <a

  <i>That man was created in the image of God, after His likeness, but that the
  whole human race fell in the sin of Adam and was brought under eternal
  condemnation and judgment;</i> that man can in no way obtain forgiveness and
  salvation through any work of his own. <a

  <i>That the souls of the lost remain after death in misery until the final
  judgment of the great white throne when soul and body reunited at the
  resurrection shall be cast <q>into the lake of fire</q></i> which is <q>the
  second death</q> to <q>be punished with everlasting destruction from the

  We belive the Bible’s clear teaching that marriage is only between one man and
  one woman. <q>Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave
  unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh</q> and <q>Thou shalt not lie with
  mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination</q>. <a

    Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they
    may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: and

    ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.<br/>
