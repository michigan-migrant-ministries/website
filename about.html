          <h1>How God began M.M.M</h1>
<p>
  As a result of a fire which destroyed Mark and Bambie Getz’s home, their
  family moved from Hartford, MI to Millburg in 2001. It was then that God made
  Bambie aware of the hundreds of Mexican families who lived on farms and worked
  the fields. Being especially burdened for the children, she called her sister,
  Sophia, in Kentucky and begged her to come start something for the Mexican
  children. In June of 2002 Sophia arrived and volunteered at a Head Start
  school for Migrant children. Because of interacting with the little students
  and their parents she established a good friendship with the families. As she
  rode the buses she learned the locations of the farm labor camps. In 2004 God
  led Sophia to begin having Bible Clubs in the migrant camps. Many children
  have accepted Christ and are now being discipled by continued weekly Bible
  studies and other activities.
</p>

<h1>The ministry</h1>

<h2>Weekly Bible classes</h2>
<p>
  Since 2002, 46 farms (migrant camps) have been reached with the Gospel.
  Fourteen or more of those farms are visited weekly to offer a Bible lesson for
  the children, along with songs, verses and a craft.
</p>

<h2>5 day clubs</h2>
<p>
  One effective method of sharing truth with the kids is going to the same farm
  five days in a row to teach Bible lessons, using a format similar to Chilid
  Evangelism Fellowship.
</p>

<h2>Day camp</h2>
<p>
  In August of 2007 we hosted our first Day Camp (ages five through High
  School). Every year God expands our outreach and in 2016, close to 400
  children registered. Over the years kids from seven school districts have been
  involved. If we did not offer transportation, they would not be able to come.
  As a result, our bus routes are composed of vans, cars, shuttle and school
  buses in order to accommodate everyone who needs a ride. On Fridays we invite
  the parents to come hear their kids’ program and enjoy a Mexican dinner
  together. The Gospel is clearly given in Spanish and English during a ‘chalk
  talk’ message at the end of the night. Without the many who volunteer to help,
  it would be impossible.
</p>

<h2>Despedida&mdash;<i><q>going away</q></i></h2>
<p>
  In October of each year we have a party for the Migrant families who by that
  time are preparing to leave Michigan. This event is well attended by the
  parents and they have as much fun as their children! After a special dinner,
  hayride, campfire and other activities we give the Gospel by way of a chalk
  art picture and message. Each family receives a small gift bag in which tracts
  and a Bible are included.

  <p>
    Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger
    that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and
    fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: and
    that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to
    fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over
    Jordan to possess it.<br/>
