    Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they
    may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: and
    that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as
    ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.<br/>
